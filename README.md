XLib (eXplanation Library) is a framework to enable Model Interpretation for all forms of model to help one build an Interpretable machine learning system often needed for real world use-cases. It is a python library designed to demystify the learned structures of a black box model both globally(inference on the basis of a complete data set) and locally(inference about an individual prediction) using different approach(explainer).
